          <h2>The Meaning of "Stress"</h2>

            <p class="mb-1">To be stressed means that:</p>

            <ul class="mb-8">
              <li>There is a heavy demand placed upon us, which needs a lot of physical and/or mental power to cope with. Such a demand is called a <strong>STRESSOR</strong>.</li>
              <li>We feel tension or a mismatch between the demand placed upon us and our own abilities and/or desire to meet that demand.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <p>
            Everybody is subjected to some sort of stress in their daily lives. This is <strong>normal</strong>, and a certain amount of stress is necessary to do anything. It is good to remember that stress can be a <strong>positive</strong> as well as a negative influence.</p>

            <p>A personâ€™s <strong>perception</strong> of their ability to cope with stress is individual and unique. These perceptions affect us physically, psychologically and emotionally and can have an impact on your ability to carry out your job as an OJTI. Of course, stress also impacts your student and as the instructor, being able to <strong>detect</strong> when your student is stressed will help you to decide what instructing strategies to adopt.</p>

          <p>Remember - stress in itself is not always a bad thing. Short-term stress is not only useful, it gives us the impetus to respond to problems.  When we feel stressed by something, chemical changes occur in our bodies which prepare us to deal with whatever it is that makes us stressed e.g. adrenalin rush or heightened alertness.  When the activity is over, the body returns to normal and no harm has been done; the body has adapted and we remain healthy.</p>

          <p>However, the body cannot cope so readily with the impact of continual stress over longer periods of time.  As a stressful situation continues, the body struggles to cope and damage is done.</p>

          <p>An effective way to alleviate stress is to <strong>identify</strong>, <strong>monitor and</strong> attempt to <strong>remove</strong> as many of the stressors as possible, for yourself and your student.</p>

          <h2>Stress Appraisal</h2>

          {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">3 panel</p> #}

          <p>The perception of something as a stressor contains an appraisal i.e. "What is this demand that is being placed upon me?"</p>

          <p>Immediately following this primary appraisal is a secondary appraisal. "Can I cope with the demand?"</p>

          <p>The appraisal of stressors and subsequent reaction is called the Stress Reaction.</p>

          <p>Stressors and Stress Reactions can be classified into <strong>three</strong> fundamental <strong>categories</strong> of stress, which we will now discuss.</p>

          <h2>Reactions to Stressors</h2>

          <p>It is important to remember that we all cope and react to stress in different ways, each of us have differing levels of tolerance and different methods of coping.  We also perceive the type and intensity of stress differently.</p>

          <h2>Symptoms of Stress in a Student</h2>

          <p>Stress with negative short-term effects will arise, both for the student and the OJTI.</p>

          <p>The <strong>symptoms</strong> are most noticeable when the person is in stress overload. However, remember that many students, for several reasons, are able to hide their symptoms through various  strategies. This may lead you to think that there is no problem, or make it difficult to realise that there is a problem. This may make the <strong>recognition</strong> of stress symptoms in others <strong>very difficult</strong>.</p>

          {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">tabs</p> #}

          <p>In general, responses to stress overload fall into one of four categories:</p>

                  <p>Physical stressors are familiar to us all and generally get the most attention. They come in various shapes and forms, from acute chronic pain to inflammation and suffering from an illness. 43% of all adults suffer adverse health effects from stress.</p>

                  <p>The <strong>immediate</strong> physical response to a stressful situation involves overall heightened arousal of the body such as increased blood pressure, tensing of the muscles and the release of sugars and fats into circulation to provide fuel for "fight or flight".</p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Prolonged</strong> stress and its continuous effects on the body may produce longer-term physical symptoms such as muscle tension and pain, headaches, gastrointestinal problems and decreased immunity to infectious diseases.</p>

                    <strong>Sleep</strong> is a big factor with adrenal fatigue. Most of us don't sleep enough or the quality of our sleep is generally poor. On top of that, we are always on the go and rarely take the rest and time out that we need.</p>

                    <strong>Prolonged</strong> stress may affect thinking (a.k.a cognition).</p>

                  <p>It is important to remember that one or more of these symptoms <strong>in isolation</strong> may not necessarily point to a problem, but it could be a tell-tale sign of possible future problems.</p>

                  <p>These symptoms do not necessarily appear simultaneously and some physical symptoms may have causes other than stress. Part of the problem is that it is often the case that stress does not show itself in such an obvious way. Some forms of stress, even of a major degree, may be <strong>masked</strong> by activity.</p>

                  <p>The most common and obvious signs of stress are generally recognised as persistent tiredness, anxiety and depression, but any reactions, including those we have mentioned, can be an indication of stress, especially if they are <strong>out-of-character</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Effects of Stress on Training</h2>

            <p>Prolonged stress may affect thinking (a.k.a. cognition) as well as emotions and behaviour. This is a serious issue for students, as problems with judgement, attention, or concentration pose a great risk to air safety.</p>

            <p>For example, under high stress conditions there is a tendency to oversimplify problem solving and ignore important relevant information, taking the "easy way out." This is called the <strong>Simplification Heuristic</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Stress-related Regression</h3>

            <p>Many individuals under high stress conditions will also <strong>forget learned procedures and skills</strong> and revert to <strong>bad habits</strong> in a phenomenon called Stress-Related Regression.</p>

            {% image "images/forgetting.jpg",
            "ATCO during OJT." %}

            <p>For example, a student controller managing a very busy arrival sequence may forget to cancel speed restrictions on some aircraft and after realising the problem, may start feeling stressed and embarrassed. He may then decide to use vectoring instead of speed control. This action would be contrary to his training and represents a kind of regression or failure to utilize prior learning.</p>

            <h3>Perceptual Tunnelling</h3>

            <p>Yet another stress-related cognitive error is Perceptual Tunnelling. It is a phenomenon in which an air traffic controller or a team under high stress becomes <strong>focused on one stimulus</strong>, such as an aircraft experiencing an unusual situation, and <strong>neglects</strong> to attend to other important <strong>tasks</strong> or <strong>information</strong>, such as other aircraft in the sector which require climb or descent clearances.</p>

            {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">Is it worth referencing this quite famous example of perception tunneling? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzlvgtPIof4</p> #}

            <p>Beyond affecting memory, judgement and attention, stress can even decrease hand-eye coordination and muscle control.</p>

            <p class="">Any stress that interferes with the quality of training must be considered to be relevant. Let's look at some of the consequences:</p>

            <p>There is <strong>no way we can eliminate all stress</strong> from the training process and since certain types of stress are positive and productive (Challenge) we would not want to. Stress is inherent in the process of exposure to the unknown, and as we all know, no matter how much theory or simulated practice you have had, "real life" is another world!</p>

            <p>Stress of the "threat" or of the "harm/loss" type is capable of interfering significantly with training. As we have discussed, these types of threats can occur as a result of the training process or originate from events outside training.</p>

            <p>Regardless of where it comes from, if it reaches a level that is difficult for the student to cope with, stress will have a counterproductive effect on training.</p>
