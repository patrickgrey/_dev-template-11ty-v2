        <p>As an OJTI you should constantly make mental and written notes on your student's abilities, capabilities and achievements (even lack of achievement) during the day to day monitoring and debriefing sessions. Elements of these notes form the basis of the training reports. Like assessments there are two types, Formative reports and Summative reports.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Formative reports</strong> are mainly intended to be used to enhance the communication between the OJTI and the student. This will help with continuity as well as giving the student a written summary of the verbal feedback, something to reflect upon. Where one OJTI is handing off to another OJTI in the training team, these reports may be the only form of communication between one to the other. However, we would always recommend it is in addition to a face-to-face &ldquo;hand over&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Training Managers will need to see <strong>Summative reports</strong> to monitor students' progress and consider who is eligible for final assessment and the issue of a licence. Similarly, they will need information if there are difficulties with a particular student and will use this information to decide on appropriate remedial training or other action to be taken.</p>

        <h2>OJTI's Responsibilities and Guidance</h2>
        <p>Be honest and be factual when writing reports. Compare the student's performance to a fixed standard &ndash; absolute not relative measurement. Can the student do the job to the required standard? Of course, this means that an OJTI needs to be clear what the &ldquo;required standard&rdquo; is. This is not an easy task and requires a clear and detailed UTP <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
            <strong>together</strong>
          </span> with extensive training of instructors to harmonise the assessment of performance objectives, and how this relates to the performance given by a trainee.</p>
        <p>As was stated earlier, OJTIs must find a balance to their feedback and the same is true when dealing with guidelines to writing reports. Strengths and weaknesses should be detailed using these principles:</p>
        <h3>State:</h3>
        <p>What the student is and not what he is not</p>
        <ul class="guidelines">
          <li>Avoid judgements &lsquo;not bad at ..' &lsquo;not very good at &hellip;'</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Precision as to the nature of the problem</p>
        <p>Give recommendations when fairly certain as to cause of problem</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remedial actions are based on this.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Write what you are sure about</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Factual justification to readers of reports</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Involve student in report writing to add value</p>
        <p>Readable and concise</p>

        <h2>Pitfalls to maintaining objectivity</h2>

        <p>The following are potential pitfalls that an OJTI can easily fall into when writing a report, either through lack of factual notes taken during a session or for more personal issues.</p>
        <p>Halo effect</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Biased focus &ndash; only key areas of ATC skills. Sometimes another OJTI tells you to &ldquo;watch out for his strip marking&rdquo; and then you only focus on this during the session.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Consistent error</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Always rating severely or leniently, sometimes for incorrect method of raising confidence in a struggling student.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Error of contrast or similarity</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Comparison to own ability/attitudes/behaviour or that of another student you may be training.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Error of central tendency</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Refusal to give &ldquo;very high&rdquo; or &ldquo;very low&rdquo; assessments. His reports will not become contentious and will lead to an &ldquo;easier life&rdquo;.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Selective perception</p>
        <ul>
          <li>OJTI/Assessor forms opinion of student's potential and thus perceives only aspects of student's behaviour that conforms to this opinion. E.g. after only first week of training states &ldquo;He's never going to make it!&rdquo;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A clearly written factual report, is generally the distillation of the correct application of the described training structure detailed in this course. It is an extremely important part of the whole OJTI methodology and should not be rushed or viewed as just a &ldquo;tick in the box&rdquo; part at the end of the training process.</p>

        <h2>Finally</h2>
        <p>Throughout this course it has been continually stressed how important harmonisation of the training and assessment units are within an organisation. That, understanding the standard required of the declared competencies within a competency based training framework is fundamental to the creditability of any UTP and UCS.</p>
        <p>Therefore, a possible method of harmonising your OJTIs would be to get them all to view the same training sessions and then write a report including assessment of the performance of the student. Find out where there are differences and, most importantly, why there are differences. It will never be possible to eliminate slight variations of assessment of performance or differences of opinion due to the very nature of the job but every effort must be made to minimise these variations as much as possible.</p>
