        <p>Throughout this course, we have discussed why it is important to inform a student about how they are performing. To motivate, to instil <strong>confidence</strong>, to bring <strong>clarity</strong> to the training process and to show the student where their performance stands against the <strong>required standard</strong>. In the Debrief this all culminates in the stage where we give a "Clear and overall assessment" against the standard required of the student.</p>

        <p>As mentioned earlier in the course, assessments can be of two types:</p>
        <h2>Formative</h2>
        <p>
          These are daily assessments written by the Instructors about the student. Their purpose is to summarise day to day sessions and review progress. They focus on the <strong>professional development</strong> of the student, highlighting <strong>personal shortcomings, preparation for improvement and information for the student's other OJTIs</strong>. They should always be <strong>factual</strong> in content.</p>

        <h2>Summative</h2>
        <p>
          These are the milestone checks or final check-out according to the UTP. Normally carried out by someone <strong>not involved</strong> in training that particular student. These assessments can be both <strong>verbal and written together with a practical check</strong>. Again they are <strong>factual</strong> in content.</p>
        <p>Most formative assessments and all summative assessments will need to be recorded digitally or in writing. Written reports are the main way in which students' progress is recorded. This report can then be transmitted and the contents shared between members of the student's training team and training management, who are permitted access to this information.</p>
