          <p>An aspect of the OJT process that requires total focus on the part of the Instructor is during the Handover / Takeover of a working position by a trainee. If the trainee is taking over from the off-going ATCO, and depending on the working position and the HMI, it may be that the Instructor cannot plug her/his headset into the working position until the off-going ATCO has removed their headset plug. During this time, the <strong>OJTI does not get exactly the same "traffic picture"</strong> as the trainee if it is not possible to hear the transmissions made by aircraft on the frequency.</p>

        <div class="oj-hero"></div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>When the traffic levels warrant it, you should ensure that, before the trainee takes over the control of the position, you know what they plan to do. Consider these questions:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-4 oj-two-questions">
          <p>
            <strong>What will be your first three transmissions?</strong><br/>
            <span>(Checks prioritisation)</span></p>
          <p>
            <strong>What is your plan with the DLH1234 and SWR4321?</strong><br/>
            <span>(If action is needed soon)</span></p>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>The OJTI needs to ensure that they are in a position to <strong>hear</strong> all the information the off-going ATCO passes to their trainee and to <strong>check it is complete</strong>. Only when the OJTI is satisfied can the Handover be accepted.</p>

          <p>It has been documented that <strong>many incidents in ATC happen within the first five minutes of a Handover / Takeover</strong> due to various reasons. <strong>Incomplete</strong> transfer of all essential information, <strong>hurried</strong> Handover and the ATCO taking over <strong>not fully understanding</strong> the traffic situation.</p>

          <p>Many organisations have developed acronyms to endeavour to ensure all relevant information is passed from the off-going to the ATCO taking-over. NATS UK developed "<strong>WEST</strong>" which is displayed on the mouse pads at the working position if relevant.</p>
