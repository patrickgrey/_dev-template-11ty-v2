          <p>During training, situations will arise where you need to intervene. These interventions will <strong>disrupt</strong> the trainee's thought processes and often lead to changes in the sequences of <strong>actions</strong> the trainee carries out. Bear in mind that for the trainee, any intervention will cause the trainee to mentally <strong>pause</strong> what they are doing or the plan they are carrying out, <strong>listen</strong> to what you are saying, <strong>understand</strong> what is required of them, and then <strong>act</strong>.</p>

          <h2>When to intervene?</h2>

          <p>As the instructor, you decide when and for what reason to intervene, e.g. point of safety, demonstration, error correction or instruction to reduce workload.</p>

          <p>This decision is influenced by issues such as:</p>

              <h3>Knowledge of and relationship with trainee</h3>
               In the early stages of the OJTI/Trainee relationship you may not know how competent the trainee is, or be unsure of their work style or weak areas and may choose to intervene sooner.</li>
            <li class="second_img">
              <h3>Your mental and physical wellbeing</h3>
               Instructing is a demanding task and there are likely to be days when you recognise that due to tiredness or other factors, you are not performing optimally. In this situation you may choose to intervene earlier to ensure that you maintain a safe environment.</li>
            <li class="third_img">
              <h3>Level of complexity</h3>
               The traffic density and complexity may cause the trainee's workload to go above what was stated in the T/O's and you may decide that it will be unproductive, or even detrimental, to try and let the trainee work continue.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>There are <strong>no limits</strong> on when intervention could be needed. New situations are always cropping up and this is likely to continue as levels of traffic and complexity increase. Constantly changing operational conditions are something that we all have to live with. It is important to <strong>remain vigilant and aware</strong> that you may need to step in at a moment's notice - it may even be for a situation you yourself may not have come across before.</p>
