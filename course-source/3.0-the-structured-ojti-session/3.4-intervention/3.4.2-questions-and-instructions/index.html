          {# <p>You've already completed an entire section on questioning techniques so this part is quite brief.</p>

          

          <p>You will usually spot what tasks need to completed, or problems that need to be solved, before your trainee sees them. Questions can be used to guide the trainee to the task or problem in a way that enhances their learning and encourages the development of situational awareness.</p>
          
           #}

          <p>Questioning is one of the <strong>primary techniques</strong> you will use during training to enable a trainee to learn the skills, judgement and attitudes of ATC, and ultimately become a competent controller. Your choice of question and the way in which you ask will vary depending on many factors, such as:</p>

              <p>What you want to achieve (What do I need to find out?)</p>

            <li>
              <p>The operational situation at the time (How much time do I have for this Q&amp;A?)</p>

          <p>This section is focussed on questioning techniques you may use during <strong>operational monitoring</strong>; however, the same techniques can be <strong>applied during the briefing and debriefing</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Although there are many different reasons for asking a question, there are some reasons that occur more often than others do and it can be useful to become familiar with these as a starting point. As you become more experienced, you will find that your technique becomes more refined.</p>

          <p>In the <strong>toolbox</strong> below you will find the most common reasons for wanting to ask a question, the situations where this might occur and the way in which the questions might be asked. There is also a section on examples of follow-up questions that may be asked.</p>

        <p>You will usually spot traffic conflicts and tasks that need doing before your trainee sees them. Questions can be used to guide the trainee to the conflict or task in a way that enhances their learning and encourages their development of situational awareness.</p>

        <p>Remember that &ldquo;questions&rdquo; are a form of intervention into the normal work of your trainee. When you intervene, you are interrupting their normal thought processes. Always bear in mind that it may take some time for them to process and answer your question, even when the answer is obvious to you. You will quickly overload your trainee if you do not carefully choose how to ask questions, the number of questions and the timings of such questions.</p>

          <h3>Enough time</h3>
          {% image "images/time-enough.jpg", "Relaxed OJTI and student as they have enough time for questions." %}

          <p>The questions that you ask <strong>gradually focus</strong> the trainee on the problem while giving maximum opportunity for her/him to spot what needs to be done without being told directly.</p>

          <p>So you may go through a set of step-by-step questions something like the one's below:</p>

          <ol class="mb-8">
            <li>What needs to be done now?</li>
            <li>Have all aircraft that need climb been given climb?</li>
            <li>Are your levels all good?</li>
            <li>What's your plan with DLH123?</li>
            <li>What is DLH123's exit level?</li>
          </ol>

          <p>This type of gradual questioning can only take place in an operational situation where there is <strong>enough time</strong> to do this. You will need to judge if the trainee has enough time to engage with your questions and still be able to maintain the traffic picture.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Limited time</h3>
          {% image "images/time-limited.jpg", "OJTI and student concentrating as the traffic situation is busy." %}
          <p>If a situation is becoming urgent or the time is <strong>limited</strong>, step-by-step questioning build up is not the best intervention, especially if the trainee senses that there is an urgency to the questions. It may be better to go straight to the issue and ask the question - 'what is DLH123s exit level?'</p>

      <div class="ians-column">

        <p>Instructions are <strong>clear</strong>, <strong>specific</strong> statements directed at the trainee that the OJTI expects the trainee to carry out.</p>

        <p>These instructions can be for many reasons. It can be to address a <strong>safety</strong> issue but often instructions and <strong>not necessarily</strong> because the trainee has done something wrong. Instructions are given to trainees in the early stages of training as part of the <strong>support</strong> that the OJTI provides, and it should be understood by the trainee that just because an instruction has been given by the OJTI does not mean that they are under-performing.</p>

        <p>A skilled OJTI can use a <strong>few instructions</strong> at the <strong>appropriate moment </strong>to ensure the trainee's workload does not exceed what was stated in the coaching conditions and as a result, the trainee can continue to train and be assessed according to the training objectives set.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>Letâ€™s take a look at some situations where Dragan asks questions and gives instructions, to understand what information he is looking for, what he is helping Carla to learn and why he sometimes choses to issue instructions instead of asking questions.</p>
