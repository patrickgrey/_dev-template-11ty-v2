          <p class="mb-8">In practice, there are many ways that errors can be made. To make it easier to discuss errors, we have put them into four broad categories. The categories start with the most severe situation and ends with the least severe.</p>

                  <p>
              These can often be predicted based on the point the trainee is at in their learning in relation to the training objectives in the UTP or their level of exposure to operational traffic. If a trainee who is in the early stages of training were to encounter situations that are expected in the final stages of training (e.g. dense traffic), you can expect that they are likely to make errors. If they encounter an unusual situation that they have not been taught to manage (e.g. degraded systems), they are likely to make errors.</p>

                    <strong>Remedy:</strong>
                  </p>

                  <p>Intervene to correct, if possible, immediately, otherwise as soon as reasonable taking into consideration safety and the trainee workload. It may be that the error is corrected immediately but discussion about why it needed to be corrected is delayed to later when the traffic situation allows.</p>

              <div class="ians-grid-2 ians-grid-2-oj-wide">
                <div>

                  <p>These are mistakes that do not have safety implications and are more concerned with alternative or more efficient ways to do something. By delaying the correction, the situation will play out and the trainee will learn why some choices may be better than others. For example:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Trainee makes a planning decision that requires less effort (i.e. familiarity) but will increase workload slightly</li>
                    <li>Trainee makes an innovative decision about the sequence of traffic they will set up on final approach, but your experience allows you to see that the decision is not going to provide the most efficient sequence and is going to be a lot of work for the trainee to carry out</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p class="mb-0 mt-0">
                    <strong>Possible Remedy:</strong>
                  </p>

                  <p>Give support to trainee to use untried methods but always be careful that you don't lose your own situational awareness! You will also need to make a judgement call as to how much inefficiency in the operation can be allowed (for training purposes). After the shift, debrief on the advantages and disadvantages, so that the trainee can reflect on the choices they made and the alternatives that could have been used.</p>

                <p>These are actions that a trainee may take simply because they lack of experience. Examples include when the trainee is slow to respond to a request (keeps transmitting "Stand by") or the trainee is "thinking on the R/T".</p>
