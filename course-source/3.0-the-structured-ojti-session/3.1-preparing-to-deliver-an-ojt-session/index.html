          <p>When preparing yourself to deliver an OJT session, there are some basic principles that should help your <strong>preparation</strong>. Trainees will have more confidence in you as an instructor if you are demonstrating that you have taken the time to understand where they are in their training and the <strong>support</strong> that they need from you.</p>

          <p class="mb-0">Watch the following video as Dragan prepares himself for an instructing session:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-2">
          {% vimeo "637022637?h=daf5a4146b" %}
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>Here is a summary of the four points made in the video of how you go about preparing yourself:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-2">
          <ol class="oj-list-blocks ians-grid-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Who</strong> is the trainee?</li>
            <li>Read the trainee's <strong>report</strong>. If you are the first OJTI, look at her/his reports from pre-OJTI.</li>
            <li>What is to be done? <strong>Training objectives</strong> appropriately selected (UTP &amp; Reports).</li>
            <li>Prepare to explain and overcome reported <strong>weaknesses</strong>.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>And remember to be fully <strong>committed</strong> to your instructing role. This is vital. As a new OJTI, you may not appreciate how much energy and effort is required to be an effective instructor. We are all human and have good days and bad days, and so we all need to be honest and ask ourselves, "<strong>Am I really up for training today?</strong>" A half-hearted approach to your trainee's session could seriously damage the OJTI/Student relationship and, more critically, set the trainee back in their progress.</p>

          <h2>How to decide 'What is to be done?'</h2>

          <p>As part of your preparation, you should determine 'What is to be done' (Point 3 above). This is when you determine <strong>what training objectives</strong> you will set for the session with your trainee. Let's take a bit of time to consider how and why it is important to set training objectives.</p>

          <p>Ultimately, a trainee will have to demonstrate all the behaviours associated with being a competent air traffic controller. The description of the final competence and observable behaviours should be described in the Unit Competence Scheme as the Competence Model. However, for a trainee to learn the job, <strong class="oj-strong-highlight">these competencies need to be 'converted' into manageable training objectives that are directly related to the airspace, sector and/or aerodrome position they are working</strong>,  specific to the procedures of that environment and appropriate for the phase of training the trainee is undertaking. The OJTI will also need to consider <strong>previous reports</strong> of the trainee's progress to work out what the most useful training objectives would be for the session.</p>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-2">

          <h3 class="mt-12">Practical example</h3>

        </div>

        <div class="oj-lowlight-grey mt-8 mb-12">
          <div class="ians-column-wide-4 a2-practical-example">
            <p>Dragan has read Carla's last five training reports and a common thread to the feedback is that often <strong>she fails to plan</strong> what to do with aircraft prior to entering her airspace. This is particularly the case when the <strong>traffic starts to increase</strong>. It is clear that with some <strong>earlier planning</strong>, conflicts can be prevented and climbs/descents can be expedited.</p>

            {% image "images/DSC00923.jpg",
            "Dragan reading." %}

            <p>A second common issue is that when it starts to get busy (i.e. going above medium traffic levels) Carla initially <strong>issues safe IFLs but then runs out of time</strong>, or <strong>fails to establish a plan</strong> to get the aircraft to their RFL. As a result, aircraft are <strong>levelling off unnecessarily</strong>. This is a major issue in this airspace as failure to expedite climbs/descents can have negative impacts on adjacent sectors.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        {#  <div class="ians-column-wide-2">
            
          </div>
        </div> #}

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>Consulting the Competence Model, Dragan can see that both these issues are related to the competence called "<strong>Traffic and Capacity Management</strong>" and that for Carla to be considered as competent she will eventually need to demonstrate, in all traffic conditions and 100% of the time, the following observable behaviours:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Manages traffic</strong> using the prescribed procedures</li>
            <li>Issues clearance and instructions in a <strong>timely manner</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Uses <strong>appropriate techniques</strong> to manage the traffic</li>
          </ul>

          <p>However, Dragan knows that Carla is not at the final competence standard yet as she is still early in her OJT and so it is not expected that she will demonstrate the behaviours perfectly or in all traffic conditions. He needs to develop training objectives for their current session that will <strong>help her on the path</strong> to the final competence standard but that are <strong>achievable</strong> given her current level of performance.</p>

          <p>He decides that the following training objectives will be most beneficial for the session:</p>

          {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">Split panel with text overlay for objective. TO number is extra highlighted.</p> #}

        </div>

        <div class="oj-TOs-notes">
          <div class="ians-column-wide-4 ians-grid-2">
            <div>
              <div>
                {% image "images/DSC00833.jpg",
                "Carla at working position." %}
                <div>
                  <h4>Training Objective 1</h4>
                  <p>Plan aircraft crossing the sector boundary, 80% of the time, in medium to heavy traffic.</p>
                </div>
              </div>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Of course, Dragan knows that when he does the briefing with Carla, they will need to spend some time discussing what steps Carla should be taking to plan the aircraft. This is part of the learning process. Preparing this discussion is part of Point 4 above (Prepare to explain and overcome reported weaknesses). Ensuring that she knows what she needs to do, prior to starting the session, will help her to feel confident that the session will be an opportunity to overcome weaknesses and build on skills.</p>

              </div>
              <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Dragan decided to put the standard at 60% based on the difficulties Carla has had in previous sessions with IFLs and to make sure that the training objective is achievable.</p>

            <em>Statement of Performance], 80% of the time [Standard], in medium to heavy traffic [Conditions]</em>

          <p class="oj-dev-notes">If interaction added, I don't think the text from "So for Dragan's two objectives..." is needed.</p> #}

          <p>In practice, you may often find that the <strong>conditions</strong> (and sometimes the standards) for two or more of the training objectives are the same.</p>

          <p>One final point about the standards. What does it mean for the OJTI when they have described a standard for the training objective in terms of <strong>percentages</strong>?</p>

          {# <p class="oj-percent">%</p> #}

          <p>Using the example of a standard that says the trainee needs to achieve something 80% of the time. <strong>If a training objective is directly related to <span class="oj-strong-highlight">safety</span>, then even though the trainee may only need to meet the objective 80% of the time, the OJTI will need to support the trainee for the other 20% to ensure that safety is maintained 100% of the time</strong>. However, if the training objective is related to efficiency, then the OJTI may decide 20% of the time to wait and see if the trainee will detect that there is an action to be performed. And, in some instances, the OJTI may combine these approaches - sometimes supporting and sometimes allowing a non-damaging inefficiency to occur.</p>
