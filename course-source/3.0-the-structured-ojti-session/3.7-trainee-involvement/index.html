          <p>There will be times, planned or otherwise; that you will involve your trainee in the early stages of OJT by <strong>delegating a particular task</strong>. This can be done for various reasons:</p>

            <p>When you are confident that the trainee has the picture, they can take control of a delegated task but you still retain full control. You could, for example, ask the trainee if they are ready to do the R/T, or alternatively take over the strip-marking but <strong>make sure you monitor their actions!</strong>
