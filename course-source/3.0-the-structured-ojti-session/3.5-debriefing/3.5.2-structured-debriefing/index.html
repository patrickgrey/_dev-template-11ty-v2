          "Nine Part Briefing" is used during the course.</p>

                <h3>Put the trainee at ease</h3>
                <p>How you achieve this will in many ways depend upon your personality and that of the trainee. A trainee who feels at ease with their instructor, even if the session has not been optimal, will be more likely to learn from the debriefing.</p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3>Ask the trainee for their opinion of their performance</h3>
                <p>Start by briefly reviewing the objectives that were set during the briefing. This is a good lead in to thinking about what has happened during the session and to have some level to measure the performance against.</p>
                <p>Ask the trainee how they felt the session went. If the trainee makes generalised statements such as "It went quite well" or "That was terrible!", encourage them to be more specific about why they hold the view that they do.</p>
                <p>If the trainee's overall opinion is similar to yours, the task of debriefing will be much easier. If, however, it differs considerably and the trainee has an unrealistic view of what is acceptable, then you are aware from the outset and you can guide the trainee towards a more evidence-based viewpoint of the performance.</p>

              </div>

              {% vimeo "715495875?h=be6f071e7b" %}

              <div>
                <h3>Discuss the trainee's strengths</h3>
                <p>First, discuss the main strengths of the performance during the session starting with the most important ones, and then, in what may be seen as a descending order, to go over the remainder of the trainee's behaviours and positive accomplishments.</p>
                <p>The main strengths should discussed in relation to training objectives set, followed by other strengths you want to mention. Again, be specific, be able to back up your points with evidence from the session and avoid generalisations.</p>

              </div>

              {% vimeo "715496221?h=37173a0c45" %}

              <p>All trainees have strengths as well as weak spots. By starting with strengths, the trainee will feel more comfortable when you then look at the shortcomings. Focusing on weak points straight away can be very disheartening. </p>

              <p>If the trainee has a really bad session, be honest! Acknowledge it and communicate empathy (understanding) but not sympathy (feeling sorry for them). All trainees have bad days now and then, and sometimes that simply needs to be acknowledged.</p>

            </div>

            <div data-atabs-panel data-atabs-tab-label="4" class="atabs__panel_4">
              <div>
                <h3>Discuss the trainee's weaknesses</h3>
                <p>Discuss the major weaknesses, starting with the most serious problems and then follow on with the remaining weaknesses. Weaknesses are evaluated against the objectives set.</p>
                <p>If a trainee has many problem areas, you may want to consider which weaknesses to discuss as too many may completely overwhelm and demoralise them. The objective of this stage is to understand the weaknesses so that progress can be made towards addressing them. Don't forget that OJT will go on over months in most cases - you don't have to solve everything or every problem in one go!</p>

              </div>

              {% vimeo "715498908?h=859230aa94" %}
              <p>It often happens that as you discuss one of the major weaknesses, you end up addressing some of the smaller ones.</p>
              <p>Remember, "criticism", no matter how objective, is hard for most to accept. It is difficult to take personal disappointment and emotion out of these situations. Dealing with the relevant facts in an honest, calm and constructive way will help de-personalise issues.</p>

                <h3>Review the main points</h3>
                <p>The previous two stages can sometimes be lengthy and so, this is time to recap briefly the main strengths and weaknesses.</p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <h3>Agree on any remedial action</h3>
                <p>Agree on what can be done in future to overcome agreed weaknesses and reinforce strengths. It is vitally important that your trainee goes away from a session knowing how or what to try to overcome problems faced. Your reference for this part of the discussion should be the T/Os with their performance and standards. It is possible that you agree that these issues become the basis for the training objectives for the next sessions.</p>
                <p>Allow your trainee to suggest remedial actions that they would like to try so long as you are in agreement with the rationale. This will encourage the trainee to take responsibility for their own learning.</p>

                <p>Provide an overall assessment of the performance.</p>
                <p>This should be an honest assessment. Remember two things, it is not what you say but the way in which you say it and <strong>to deny a problem is to deny the person the opportunity to overcome the problem.</strong>

          <h2>Giving an Abbreviated Debriefing</h2>

          <p>There will be times when it is not necessary to give a full debriefing. This typically happens at the very end of the training period when the trainee is ready for assessment, or when the OJTI and student have been working on the same objectives for a number of sessions.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the trainee must have some form of feedback. In these situations an abbreviated debriefing should be given.</p>
          <p>The following shorter debrief may be used:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-2">
          <ol class="oj-list-blocks">
            <li>
              <strong>Ask</strong> the trainee for their <strong>opinion</strong>
            </li>
            <li>If they talking about <strong>weaknesses</strong>, put them <strong>into perspective</strong> and explain their cause</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Confirm strengths</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Make a <strong>summary</strong> (including an assessment)
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Invite questions</strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>Note: <strong class="oj-strong">If they start talking about strengths first, confirm them, then ask what they thought their weaknesses were</strong>.</p>
          <p>Then continue as per Points 2, 4 and 5.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>This method should only be used with trainees who are some way into their training already.</li>
            <li>It should be used sparingly.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It should 
              <strong class="oj-strong">not</strong>
             be used with trainees who are experiencing problems.</p>
