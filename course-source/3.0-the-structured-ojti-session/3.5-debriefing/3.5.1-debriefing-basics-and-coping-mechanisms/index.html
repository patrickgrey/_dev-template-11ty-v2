          <p>The debriefing part of any training session is an all-important part of the <strong>learning</strong> process. During a debriefing, both you and your trainee are looking to see how much learning and progress has taken place in relation to the training objectives set for the session. It includes a <strong>factual</strong>, <strong>objective</strong> assessment of the trainee's performance and, if required, a new orientation for the way to progress together with remedial actions.</p>

          <p>The <strong>notes</strong> that you take during the training session are used to prepare the debriefing session.</p>

          <h2>Reasons for Debriefing</h2>

          <p>There are some key reasons that we carry out a debriefing and you will see that they are incorporated into a structured debriefing.</p>

          <p class="ians-text-instruction">Think about the purpose of a debrief and try to note down four reasons to do them below. Once you have done that, you can reveal the answers.</p>

            <h3>To discuss the trainee's strengths and weaknesses</h3>

            <p>
              It is important that trainees receive <strong>
                <u>balanced</u>
              </strong> feedback. Positive feedback on what went well is as important as feedback on areas that need improvement. At the same time, a trainee almost certainly will have <strong>self-assessed</strong> their own performance and asked questions such as "Why did some things go well when others not ?" and&hellip; "Did I perform according to the training objectives set?" The debriefing gives both the trainee and the OJTI the opportunity to discuss the trainee's performance.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="oj-notched">
            <h3>To reinforce what the trainee has learnt</h3>
            <p>
              An important part of learning is <strong>reinforcing behaviours and actions that are correct or desirable</strong>. The debriefing is an opportunity to do this and help them to stay motivated. Provide tangible examples of where they are making progress, it encourages them to continue working hard to maintain that progress. If they are <strong>unclear</strong> about whether their performance met the objectives, they could end up feeling de-motivated and frustrated. This is counter-productive.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="oj-notched">
            <h3>To help the trainee reflect on their performance</h3>
            <p>
              A trainee's reflection on their performance starts with the feedback they get during the debriefing, but this is just the start. After the debriefing, the trainee will <strong>combine this feedback</strong> with their own <strong>self-knowledge and perception</strong> of their performance to form an opinion about what they should consolidate and what actions they can take to improve in areas that still need some work. A trainee will progress more effectively if they are able to reflect on factual and concrete information provided during the debriefing.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="oj-notched">
            <h3>To discuss and determine any remedial training needs</h3>

            <p>
              If a trainee is failing to make progress, or their progress has stopped or declined for a significant period, the debriefing is the opportunity to <strong>start the discussion</strong> about what remedial help is available to support the trainee in overcoming the challenges they are facing.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <h2>When and where to Debrief</h2>

          <p>It is important to choose the <strong>right time and place</strong> to carry out an effective debrief.</p>

          {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">Split image of a private room and an inapproriate place.</p> #}

          <p>After a busy or complex training session, your trainee may not be immediately ready or receptive to the feedback on the session. They may need a bit of <strong>time to decompress and reflect</strong>. This is especially true if things have not gone as well as he would have liked.</p>

          <p>If the session has been particularly difficult, <strong>you</strong> may also need time to gather your thoughts and structure your feedback. So take a short break if possible (10 -15 minutes) before starting the debriefing.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-4 ians-grid-2 oj-debrief-where">
          <div>{% image "images/debrief-correct.jpg",
            "Two people at a desk holding a debrief" %}</div>
          <div>{% image "images/debrief-wrong.jpg",
            "Two people at a desk holding a debrief" %}</div>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>Choose a <strong>private location</strong> for the debriefing to avoid distractions and interruptions. This could be a dedicated debriefing room, an office or a meeting room. If none of these are available, try to find a space where it is unlikely that others will be able to overhear the debriefing or interrupt. A quiet location will allow the trainee to share their views freely without being overheard by others.</p>

          <h2>Remedial Actions/Training</h2>

          <p>Remedial actions are the activities undertaken to overcome problems faced during training. The remedial actions taken depends on the nature of the problem.</p>

          <p>Remedial training could include the techniques discussed earlier, such as, <strong>demonstration and talk-through</strong>, to help the trainee visualise the correct performance. It could involve a <strong>return to the simulator</strong> for a few sessions to consolidate or automate certain behaviours. It could involve a <strong>change of OJTIs</strong> if it is considered that one of the OJTIs would be a good match for type of difficulty a trainee may be having.</p>

          <p>Some trainees will think and behave in a manner that you recognise because it is similar to how you would behave. Others may think and behave differently. One of the skills of a good OJTI is the ability to <strong>adapt their teaching techniques to the needs of the trainee</strong> (within acceptable parameters and unit standards). If you can work with your trainee to try different solutions to problems they encounter, they may find the way to overcome the learning barrier they are dealing with. An OJTI who is not able to adapt their teaching to different ways of controlling traffic, may be the reason the trainee is struggling in the first place.</p>

          <p>Some Training Units have established "Remedial Training Teams" to manage with trainees training problems.</p>

          <h2>Delivering verbal feedback</h2>

          <p>A significant part of the debriefing is the delivery of feedback about a performance. We all know that it is not only the message, but <strong>the way that the message is delivered</strong> that is important. Aim to deliver feedback positively even when the performance has not been great.</p>

            </details>

            <h3>Body Language</h3>

            <p>Body language is also an important aspect of providing feedback.</p>

            {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">A series of demonstrative good/bad images.</p> #}

            <p>You are trying to cultivate an <strong>equal partner-to-partner relationship</strong>. An open, relaxed body posture passes subliminal positive messages to the trainee that you are on their side.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="ians-grid-4 oj-debrief-where">
            <div>{% image "images/body-language-good-01.jpg",

          <div class="ians-column">

            <p>Maintain eye contact when speaking with the trainee. Be aware of your tone of voice, gestures, posture and facial muscles. These can be just as telling as words themselves. Position yourself so that either one of you can break eye contact without appearing rude.</p>

            <h2>Stroking</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>
                <em>A stroke is a unit of recognition of the existence of another person as a human being.</em>
              </strong>
            </p>

            <p>There are two forms of stroking: <strong>Positive</strong> stroking and <strong>Negative</strong> stroking.</p>

            {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">Two columns here with green and red backgrounds as above but with + and - symbols.</p> #}

          </div>

          <div class="ians-column-wide-4 ians-grid-2 oj-debrief-where oj-pos-neg">
            <div>
              <h3>Positive stroking</h3>
              <p>Positive stroking can be as simple as a well-timed "<strong>Good!</strong>" comment by the OJTI. This can be particularly effective the first time your trainee achieves a training objective set for the session. This reinforces the appropriate behaviour/action and it is likely they will continue to repeat it. This is a simple and unobtrusive comment but very effective and motivational. </p>

              <p>Other positive strokes could include when your trainee has <strong>tried to solve an issue but maybe not all that successfully</strong>. You could say something like: "That was a really bold attempt at solving a tricky problem - well done for trying! So how do you think you could improve on that for the next time?" The objective is to keep your trainee motivated to keep trying to improve and not fear making mistakes.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>Negative stroking</h3>

              <p>Negative strokes can also be very simple - "Tutt-tutt!" or sharp intake of breath noises. A "comical" putting your hand over your eyes gesture. Many of these "put downs" are so-called "fun" for the benefit of an OJTI's colleagues nearby and always at the <strong>expense of the trainee</strong>. </p>

              <p>Unless you have a very strong relationship with your trainee and you know they will take it in their stride, these negative strokes will have the effect of inhibiting your trainee from trying new ideas or open up to you with any doubts. The working relationship will most definitely suffer as will the progress of the trainee.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="ians-column">

            <h2>Defence Mechanisms</h2>
            <p>The behaviours and the attitudes we adopt are often a reflection of how we cope with certain situations. We will take a brief look at "direct" and "defensive" coping strategies.</p>

            {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">Split definitions with images showing happy, anxious ATCOs.</p> #}

          </div>

          <div class="ians-column-wide-4 ians-grid-2 oj-debrief-where oj-coping">
            <div>{% image "images/coping-direct.jpg",
            "A happy ATCO." %}
              <p>
                <strong>Direct coping is</strong> what we would wish from our trainee. Direct coping means the trainee is acknowledging and <strong>facing up to any problems</strong> they may encounter during training. The take ownership of the challenges and take steps to work through them.</p>
            </div>
            <div>{% image "images/coping-defensive.jpg",
            "An ACTO with two hands up in a defensive gesture." %}

              <p>
                <strong>Defensive coping</strong>, <strong>is rejecting either that the problem exists or rejecting the true cause of the problem</strong>. Defensive coping may be a precursor to conflict. Your trainee may be experiencing stress. The thoughts and feelings that sometimes develop as a result will limit learning and increase the chances of a dispute or heated discussion.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="ians-column">

            <p>If you can recognise when trainees are resorting to negative, unhelpful coping strategies, you have the possibility to help them find better ways to deal with stressful situations.</p>

            <h3>Defensive Coping</h3>

            <p>Since defensive coping does not help trainee learning or progress, and is the more difficult situation to manage, we will look at it in a bit more detail.</p>

            <p>When faced with a difficult situation, people react in different ways. Some people shout and get angry or want to blame everyone, while others resort to complete denial or ignore the problem, they just 'bury their heads in the sand'. A some basic level we know (but don't necessarily admit) that these copying strategies are dysfunctional.</p>

            <p>Defensive coping strategies are not conducive to learning as the avoid confronting the source of the problem. </p>
