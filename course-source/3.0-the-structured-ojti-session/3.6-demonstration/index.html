          <p>After several months of theory and simulations the trainee may be <strong>eager</strong> to get going, or s/he may be just<strong> plain nervous</strong> - so hang on! As an OJTI, you first need to be confident that the trainee can cope with the demands of the real operational traffic and environment. This is not a simulation - this is <strong>real</strong>, with real aeroplanes and real people. The trainee in turn, needs the opportunity to get used to this new environment and how things work.</p>

          <p>To adjust into the safety critical environment, it helps to demonstrate handling live situations first. <strong>Here is a definition of demonstration</strong>:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>The two essential elements of a demonstration are to "<strong>demonstrate</strong>" and "<strong>explain</strong>".</p>

          <p>Just doing the job while your trainee looks on is <strong>not</strong> a demonstration. A demonstration should include some explanation of what it is you are doing, both practically and cognitively, that is to say the<strong> 'what'</strong> and the<strong> 'why'</strong>. So when, for example, an OJTI is highlighting a radar label it is important to explain:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-4 ians-grid-4 oj-what-why">
          <p><br/><br/>
            <strong>What</strong> s/he is doing</p>
          <p><br/><br/>
            <strong>Why</strong> s/he is doing it</p>
          <p><br/><br/>
              The <strong>information</strong> s/he gathers and processes</p>
          <p><br/><br/>
            <strong>What s/he using it for</strong> or plans to use it for</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>This is a very helpful method to use to aid a trainees understanding of how the OJTI (ATCO) performs certain tasks. Remember that the trainee can see what is happening, to some degree at least, but they can't "see" inside your head to <strong>understand</strong> what you are thinking or why you are doing certain things.</p>

          <p>During a demonstration, be <strong>precise</strong> in your explanations and use <strong>easily understood language</strong>. If you "cut corners" or "bend the rules", you can be sure your trainees will copy you, even if you tell them not to.</p>

          <h2 class="pt-0">When to use Demonstration</h2>

          <p>Demonstration is used most frequently at <strong>the beginning of a new training phase</strong>, a new simulation exercise (Pre-OJT) or, at the start of OJT. In general, it is used whenever the phase of training and the operational environment is new to the trainee, for example, unusual severe weather conditions or first time "Holding" is required.</p>

          <p>Further on in OJT, a demonstration may be used as a <strong>refresher</strong> and for demonstrating<strong> unusual situations</strong> or <strong>infrequently</strong> used procedures. Additionally, you will find it useful if the trainee appears to be <strong>regressing</strong>. Sometimes we need to take a step back in order to move forward. Towards the end of OJT, demonstrations should not be necessary.</p>

          <h2>Planning &amp; Demonstration</h2>

          <p>The technique of demonstration is generally not used <em>ad-hoc</em>, but rather it should be <strong>planned</strong> so that the trainee can get the maximum benefit from it. You <strong>can</strong> plan ahead in many areas.</p>

          <p class="ians-text-instruction">Please answer the questions below.</p>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>As you can see, you can plan ahead for most events!</p>

          <p>Before doing a demonstration, <strong>brief</strong> the trainee on <strong>what to focus on</strong> during the session otherwise there is a risk that they will simply be lost among all the different actions and activities going on at the same time. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-bg-blue-dark pb-8 pt-8">

          <div class="ians-column-wide-2 ians-grid-2 oj-example">
            <div>
              <p class="oj-example-title">
  							Example
  						</p>
              <p>So for example, the instructor may advise the trainee that during the demonstration there is likely to be a number of instances when en-route aircraft at the same level need to be kept separated and that the trainee should pay attention to the way the Mach Number technique is used for doing this.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="ojExample01" class="oj-example-image"></div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>It will benefit the trainee even more if you <strong>repeat</strong> the technique several times so that s/he can become familiar with it, especially if the procedure you are demonstrating is a complex one.</p>

          <h2>Demonstrate - Repeatedly</h2>

          <p>Demonstrate repeatedly anything that emphasises <strong>safety</strong> and operating according to <strong>procedures</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>Emphasise <strong>cause and effect</strong>. For example, explain clearly to the trainee that it is essential to check speed on approach, to ensure the previous aircraft has plenty of time to clear the runway before the next one lands and to ensure that there are always the required minima between successive aircraft.</p>

          <p>Depending on the situation presented, you could also stress the range of speeds available to aircraft at this stage of the approach. If at an early stage of the approach, you may explain why it is difficult for some aircraft to lose both height and speed at the same time. There are so many areas that could be made clear in a demonstration. Remember, clarification once will often <strong>not</strong> be enough.</p>

          {# <h2>Involve the Trainee</h2>

          <p>Demonstration should <strong>not</strong> be a <strong>passive</strong> activity for the trainee. If s/he is just sitting and watching, s/he could easily become distracted, for example, by the new surroundings, the next operational position, a new face in the room!</p>

          <p>If time allows, involve the trainee by <strong>asking questions</strong> to <strong>check comprehension</strong> and <strong>understanding</strong>.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-bg-blue-dark pb-8 pt-8">

          <div class="ians-column-wide-2 ians-grid-2 oj-example">
            <div>
              <p class="oj-example-title">
  							Example
  						</p>
              <p>For example, ask her/him to tell you what s/he would do in the case where the runway is not vacated for the next landing. This will also help you check her/his understanding of the general situation being demonstrated.</p>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p class="oj-dev-notes">I think better shots could be useful above - perhaps of just the radar screen with the particular scenario on it.</p>

          <p>Give the trainee <strong>recognition</strong> for a good response. This will boost their confidence and help them remember the current point.</p>
