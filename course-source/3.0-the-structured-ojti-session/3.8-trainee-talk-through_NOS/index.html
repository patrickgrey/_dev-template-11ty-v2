        <div class="ians-column">
          <p>Having given a demonstration, another technique for checking the trainee's understanding is by giving them the opportunity to make decisions using the talk-through technique.</p>

          <h3>Definition:</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-2">
          <blockquote>A method used by an OJTI to allow a trainee to practice making executive decisions. The OJTI retains control of the R/T but carries out the decisions made by the trainee.</blockquote>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>The benefits of this technique are similar to those mentioned for trainee involvement but has an added benefit of clearly showing what the trainees <strong>prioritisation of tasks</strong> is. Correct prioritisation is one of the first aspects of a trainee's work that begins to fall apart as they become overloaded, hesitate or misunderstand what is required of them. </p>

          <p>With the talk-through, the trainee is required to give executive decisions at the correct time through their OJTI. Prioritisation can be clearly checked this way and the OJTI can support the trainee to learn how to prioritise tasks.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-2">
          {% image "images/DSC01011.jpg", "An OJT discussing an approach with a trainee to get them involved.", "oj-image-discuss"%}
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>Brief the trainee to ensure they understand what is required and why. You may consider the following when preparing your briefing:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Do you require the trainee to give executive decisions using <strong>standard phraseology</strong> or not?</li>
            <li>Does the trainee make <strong>all</strong> the executive decisions <strong>or only some</strong> of them?</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Who marks</strong> the strips or updates the electronic strips/radar label?</li>
            <li>What should the trainee <strong>pay attention to</strong> in particular?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In the early stages of training, your ability to manage your trainees workload and ensure they have protected exposure to the tasks they need to undertake and the problems they need to resolve, is vitally important to their ability to learn and develop confidence in their abilities. As the talk-through is a very <strong>controlled environment</strong> for a trainee, it can boost their <strong>confidence</strong> and give them a chance to make decisions knowing that the OJTI is the <strong>safety net</strong> through which all those decisions will be made.</p>

          <p>As an OJTI using both Trainee Involvement and Talk-Through training techniques there is an important caveat:</p>

            <p>
              <strong>FIRST</strong> CONTROL THE <strong>TRAFFIC</strong>, <br/>
              <strong>THEN</strong> TRAIN THE <strong>TRAINEE</strong>!!</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="ians-column ">

          <p class="">Your first priority is 
                  <strong>always</strong>
                 the <strong>safety</strong> of the traffic.</p>
