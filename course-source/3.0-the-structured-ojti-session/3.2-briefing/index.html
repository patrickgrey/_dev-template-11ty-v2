          <p>In order to standardise the process of OJT and to help instructors not to forget all the important elements of a briefing, the following "Six Part Briefing" is used during the course:</p>

          {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">This should be a step through thing? Show videos in dialogue after text. Tabs along top (in style of joined dots).

                <h3>Part 1. Set the trainee at ease.</h3>

                <p>When you establish your working relationship with your trainee, it makes sense to show them that you regard them as a colleague and so treat them as you would any other colleague. Be open, approachable and take interest in them as a person. Start the briefing with some non-work related discussion where you are not the "Instructor".</p>

                <h3>Part 2. State the Training Objectives.</h3>

                <p>Training objectives can be taken from the UTP, or from reports of previous OJTIs, or because the trainee has been experiencing particular problems. It does no harm in a mature relationship to comment on why you have set these objectives. Explain fully the performance, standard and conditions of the training objectives set.</p>

                <h3>Part 3. State the Coaching Conditions.</h3>

                <p>This is the relationship between the instructor and trainee during the session i.e. what they can expect from each other.</p>
                <p>Here are some examples of the types of things the instructor may say regarding the coaching conditions:</p>

                <ol class="oj-alpha">
                  <li>Instructor will be taking notes during the session - to provide accurate feedback and not necessarily because the student has made a mistake.</li>
                  <li>Instructor will be asking questions &ndash; to understand what the trainee is planning, etc.</li>
                  <li>Instructor may be giving instructions &ndash; and the trainee is expected to comply without questioning as it could be for safety reasons. It can be discussed later if required.</li>
                  <li>The Instructor may correct errors &ndash; and not to worry about this as it is entirely normal at this stage of training.</li>
                  <li>Instructor may take over the control &ndash; and this may be for a variety of different reasons including that the Instructor is losing the picture or being overloaded. The trainee asks the Instructor to take over.</li>
                  <li>The trainee is losing the picture or an emergency occurs.</li>
                  <li>Is a demonstration planned during this session?</li>
                  <li>Can the trainee put questions to the Instructor?</li>
                </ol>
              </div>

              <p class="no-max-width">If you are working with a trainee for a period of days and weeks then this part of the briefing does not need to be continually repeated. From the list above, questions, instructions, error corrections and taking over control; are all referred to as 'Interventions by an OJTI'. In essence, the OJTI is disrupting the normal work of the trainee in some way. This is discussed again in more detail later.</p>

                <h3>Part 4. State the Working/Operational Conditions.</h3>

                <p>Has the student self-briefed on the working conditions of the day? This is the time to ask them &ndash; don't tell them! Items like, weather, traffic levels, airspace restrictions and military activity should be covered.</p>

                <h3>Part 5. Check Relevant Knowledge.</h3>

                <p>It is important to check if your trainee has understood both the training objectives and the implications of anything mentioned in Part 4. This should not be just a check of theoretical knowledge, but to ensure they understand the practical application of the objectives. </p>

                <p>What you are trying to find out is "<em>What will the trainee do practically when s/he start working the traffic</em>?" This is particularly important when your trainee has been having problems and you have set training objectives that relate specifically to these problems. </p>

                <p>Create practical scenario questions to find out how the trainee will address this objectives when you go "live". What will they say and what actions will they take? This can help to overcome misunderstandings before you start the session.</p>

                <h3>Part 6. Any Questions?</h3>

                <p>Invite your trainee to ask questions. This may be about the session and the training objectives set but can also be about anything that is concerning them with their training in general or personal issues they are facing. Be aware that when you effectively "hand the floor" to your trainee, anything can come at you, personal issues, pent up emotions, etc.</p>
