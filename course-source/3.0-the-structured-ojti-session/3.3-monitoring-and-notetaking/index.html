          <h2>OJTI Situational Awareness</h2>

          <p>Good <strong>observation skills</strong> are necessary to identify the signs that indicate the trainee is managing or running into difficulties. The instructor must also ensure that the trainee is <strong>safe</strong> and making <strong>progress</strong>.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-column">
          <p>This is so true! Training can be a very arduous task, <strong>demanding a lot from the OJTI</strong> both mentally and practically. OJTIs are also humans and will have good days and bad ones with high or low energy. To carry out instructing duties in a safety critical environment such as ATC is very demanding. </p>

          <p>You must be able to <strong>recognise</strong> the days when you are able to instruct effectively and days when you shouldn't provide instruction at all. It isn't only the trainee who will suffer if you are delivering a half-hearted, low energy performance as the traffic and your colleagues could also be impacted.</p>

          <p>Monitoring a trainee's performance is not simply a case of watching them work, making a few corrections or instructions and then telling them how it went. During the monitoring phase, the OJTI is constantly trying to ascertain <strong>what is going on inside the trainee's head</strong>, without overloading them. What information gathering is taking place and what are they doing with this information? Is their prioritisation correct and are they aware of safety issues? This, together with accurate note-taking, is essential if the OJTI is to be able to provide effective feedback on the trainee's performance that will enable them to learn, apply and progress.</p>

        <div class="oj-objective">
          <div class="ians-column-wide-2">
            <p>The objective of monitoring is to observe and scrutinise the trainee's thought processes and working practices with a view to giving objective and accurate feedback.</p>

          <h2>Monitoring what?</h2>

          <p>The question that may be raised at this point is what is it that an OJTI monitors? Is it every aspect of the trainee's performance or only particular skills, issues or problems that an OJTI pays attention to?</p>

          <p class="ians-text-instruction">Answer the question below then select the button below to read on.</p>

          <div class="oj-answer-reveal">
            <p class="mt-12">It goes without saying that monitoring to ensure <strong>safety</strong> is maintained, is a primary role of the OJTI.</p>

            <p>In addition, you monitor in relation to the <strong>training objectives</strong> that have been set for the exercise. The UTP will describe the training objectives that need to be taught before the trainee will be in a position to demonstrate competence. The UTP should not only describe the objectives, but also the <strong>level of support</strong> to be provided by the OJTI. This may range from a lot of support at the beginning of a new phase of training to almost no support towards the end of the phase.</p>
          </div>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-bg-blue-dark pt-12 pb-12 mt-12 mb-12">
          <div class="ians-column-double ians-grid-2">
            <div>
              <p class="mt-0">Training objectives may be derived from the trainee's <strong>previous reports</strong>. Is the trainee having a particular problem that needs further support to overcome? Certain training objectives can be set beyond the scope of a UTP to help overcome these issues.</p>

              <p>As we detailed in the "Briefing" topic; the training objectives for any session are set and discussed between OJTI and trainee during the briefing and prior to the monitoring phase. It should always be <strong>clear to a trainee what is expected</strong> of them during the session.</p>

              <p>It is obvious therefore, that the most important aspect of a trainee's performance, requiring <strong>monitoring and feedback</strong>, is what the OJTI has asked the trainee to achieve i.e. the <strong>training objectives</strong> set. Any other aspects of the trainee's performance can also be monitored and fed back on, particularly if it is safety related.</p>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>An OJTI must find the correct <strong>balance</strong> between how much feedback to give and how much the trainee can <strong>absorb and take forward</strong> into the next training sessions. This is a skill an OJTI must develop. <strong>Overloading</strong> the trainee with too much feedback can be harmful, as can setting too high a standard for the stage of training the trainee is at, resulting in loss of motivation and confidence.</p>

          {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">Interaction. Slider and graphic to show balance.</p> #}

          <p>And importantly, as <strong>the OJTI</strong> you must not become overloaded or over-focussed on the training, to the point of risking to lose your own situational awareness. There are typical warning signs that this may be starting to happen during a session.</p>

              <p>An example is when the OJTI is <strong>no longer asking questions</strong> but <strong>just giving instructions</strong> to keep the traffic moving or that <strong>note taking has ceased</strong> due to increasing complexity of the traffic situation.</p>

          <h2>Monitoring Considerations</h2>

          <p>When monitoring a trainee, take the following into consideration:</p>

        </div>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-5">
          <section data-atabs>
            <div data-atabs-panel="default" data-atabs-tab-label="Difficulty remembering">
              <div class="oj-monitor-panel-centre">
                <h3>Difficulty remembering details of situations</h3>
                {% image "images/writing-on-lap.jpg", "A person writing notes on their lap", "oj-tab-image" %}
                <p class="oj-monitor-panel-text oj-notched">
                  <strong>Note taking</strong>. Training sessions can be lengthy and it is vital that an OJTI's notes are accurate and detailed enough to be able to provide meaningful feedback even if it is 2-3 hours after the event.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div data-atabs-panel data-atabs-tab-label="2 mental models">
              <div class="oj-monitor-panel-centre">
                <h3>2 mental models: traffic picture &amp; trainee / traffic picture</h3>
                {% image "images/shared-model.jpg", "OJTI and student looking at the same radar screen." , "600" %}
                <p class="oj-monitor-panel-text oj-notched">
                  <strong>OJTI workload</strong>. To be able to assist the development of the trainee effectively an OJTI must have a clear understanding of what is the trainee's mental picture of the traffic situation. If workload is too high for the OJTI then this will not happen and OJTI will only have their own view to maintain safety.</p>

              </div>
            </div>

            <div data-atabs-panel data-atabs-tab-label="Monitoring complexity">
              <h3>Complexity of monitoring increases with increase in capability of trainee</h3>

              <div class="ians-grid-2 ians-grid-2-oj-wide">
                <div>
                  <p>
                    <strong>High interaction vs. boredom</strong>. It has been well documented in Skybrary that many ATC incidents under training happen in <strong>low density and / or low complexity traffic</strong>. This is particularly true if it follows a period of <strong>high density and / or high complexity traffic</strong>. The OJTI can mentally switch off and relax too much thinking that the trainee should easily be able to handle the quieter traffic. Unfortunately, on certain occasions, the trainee switches off too and errors are made which are not detected.</p>

                  <p> Monitoring workload can also be less during the early part of a trainee's training because with less expertise and experience they are almost totally guided by the OJTI. Solutions to problems faced are resolved along lines familiar to the OJTI. </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <p>As a trainee nears check-out they can be problem solving in a way that may be quite different to the OJTI's but still acceptable and safe. The problem for the OJTI is following what is happening and determining if it is indeed acceptable.</p>

                    <strong>Reading a newspaper</strong>? It has even been a "technique" used by some OJTIs to <strong>give confidence</strong> to their trainees. "<em>Look - I have so much faith in your ability I don't even need to pay attention!</em>" This technique is best avoided.</p>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Personal sphere &amp; peripheral vision</strong>. Where do you position yourself relative to the trainee and the working position? At the beginning of training, you need to be <strong>visible to the trainee</strong> because at this point you are working together and the trainee doesn't want to constantly be turning to find their instructor when they are unsure or want to ask a question. Towards the end of training you can sit further away as a trainee needs to feel that they are working on their own. However, you must still be able to see all that is happening.</p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Non-verbal comments</strong>. "Tut, tut!!" - sharp intakes of air as an instructor are not helpful and only undermine your trainee and can seriously disrupt a good working relationship.</p>

          <div>
            <p class="mt-0">Generally, people are poor at monotonous and repetitive tasks. This makes monitoring even more difficult than it already is, as it is hard to maintain concentration when only the normal daily stuff is going on. Something could happen at any moment, and if you are suffering what is known as 'vigilance effect' you might miss it!</p>

            <p>Imagine during a football match that you are a goalkeeper whose team is dominating the play. You have had nothing to do all game. Suddenly, with five minutes left, the opposition goalkeeper kicks the ball downfield. The wind gets behind it and next thing you know, you are late to react to the situation and "<strong>Bang</strong>" the ball is in the back of the net!</p>

          <h2 class="mt-12">Note-taking techniques</h2>

          <p>The way you take notes is personal to you. These notes help you to produce an effective <strong>debrief and report</strong> from the training session. During a 2-3 hour session or even longer, you will have far more notes than should ever be fed back to a trainee on. The feedback given during a debrief must be "<strong>digestible</strong>" to the trainee.</p>

        <div class="oj-hero oj-hero-notes"></div>

        <div class="ians-column">

          <p>There are however, some suggestions of styles for note-taking that you may consider using:</p>

        <div class="ians-column-wide-4 oj-notes-container">
          <div>
            <h3>Tee Squares</h3>
            <p>This is a very quick and easy method of recording simple training objectives and do not distract the OJTI from monitoring. E.g. "Transfer all aircraft to the next sectors, earliest 10nm before the T.O.C. point to latest at T.O.C. point.". Then you record if it was or was not achieved for all relevant aircraft. Where it was not achieved you may add some detail - callsign and where it was transferred.</p>
