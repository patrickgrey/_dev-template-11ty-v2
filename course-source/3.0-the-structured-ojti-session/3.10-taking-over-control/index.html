          <h3>When to Take Control?</h3>

          {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">A series of True/false questions (all true) with feedback to clarify. 3.3-demonstration/</p> #}

          <p>Different situations can arise where taking over control is necessary:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>When the trainee <strong>makes this request</strong>. Bear in mind that it may not be immediately obvious to you why the trainee is asking, so do not insist the trainee carry on. Take over and discuss later.</li>
            <li>When there is reason to believe the trainee is about to <strong>lose control</strong>, or when the situation is approaching safe limits with no apparent awareness on the part of the trainee. This may be after questioning.</li>
            <li>When situations develop that the OJTI feels the trainee will be <strong>unable to control</strong>. e.g. unusual weather or increasing traffic/workload beyond their limits.</li>
            <li>When the trainee starts to become <strong>overloaded</strong> and the <strong>value of training reduces</strong>.</li>
            <li>When you consider the situation to be testing <strong>your own limitations</strong>. If you realise that you are asking fewer questions and issuing more instructions to you trainee just to keep it safe or manageable, then there is little or no benefit for your trainee.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is also possible to take over control <strong>purely for training purposes</strong>. You may wish to demonstrate how something should be done and then hand the control back to the trainee.</p>

          <p>
            <strong>There are some visible signs and behaviours</strong> that a trainee is becoming overloaded and that it may be necessary for you to take-over. These include:</p>

          {# <p class="oj-dev-notes">We can illustrate each of these with an image.1. Pen close up 2. red face 3. sweat photo 4. Close up of mouth 5. Captioned photo with stutter 6.

        <div class="ians-column-wide-4">
          <ol class="ians-grid-4 oj-signs">

            <li>Nervous movements - shaking of the hands or legs, constant clicking of a pen.</li>

            <li>Red marks on face or neck.</li>

            <li>Excessive sweating.</li>

            <li>Making mistakes (simple or dangerous).</li>

            <li>Stuttering - presses the R/T switch and starts with "Ehh umm! ---- DLH1234 ------emm"</li>

            <li>Asking for confirmation of actions - no confidence to commit to their own work</li>

            <li>Talking through all situations - hoping that if anything they say is not correct the OJTI will correct them before making a mistake.</li>

            <li>Increased speed in deliverance of RT - trainee is in a hurry to transmit and get onto the next task.</li>

            <li>Unable to make judgements - their workload management has reduced and they are beginning to fall behind with their "to do" list.</li>

            <li>Tunnel vision - as traffic levels increase an experienced controller's field of vision increases, as they know it requires early planning to keep on top of busy traffic. It is the opposite for an inexperienced trainee who starts focusing on small areas and ignoring to plan and scan for aircraft approaching their area of operation.</li>
