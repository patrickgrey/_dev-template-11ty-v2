					In this section, we are going to cover how to deliver a structured OJT session. All OJT sessions contain the following elements, and will be covered first in this section:
				</p>

          <ol class="oj-count">
            <li>Preparing to deliver the session</li>
            <li>Briefing</li>
            <li>Monitoring and Intervention (excluding taking over control)</li>
            <li>Debriefing</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The above elements are likely to happen in all OJT sessions and will include things like questioning techniques and notetaking. However, there are some elements that only happen or are needed from time to time. We will look at these less routine situations next. They include techniques that you may call on in specific training situations and include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Doing a <strong>demonstration</strong>, and/or</li>
            <li>Using  the <strong>trainee involvement technique</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Doing a <strong>trainee talk through</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>This will be followed by some considerations for the OJTI when doing a:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Working position <strong>handover</strong> with your trainee.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Although not routine (hopefully!) it may be necessary, during a session to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Take over control</strong> from your trainee</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mb-12">To help consolidate this learning, you will be able to watch a series of videos that demonstrate each element. In these videos you will be introduced to Dragan, one of the OJT instructors and Carla, the trainee.</p>

              <h2>Dragan</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Dragan has been working on various sectors at XXX for 18 years and has been an instructor for 14 years. He is a keen believer that a competent instructor creates the environment where the trainee has every possibility to learn the job. In the Unit, Dragan has a reputation for being a very effective OJTI for trainees who are going through their early to mid-stages of OJTI where the instructor has a very active teaching role.</p>

              <h2>Carla</h2>
            </div>
            <p>This is her first ACS rating having graduated from the Academy where she was a top student. She is now approaching the midpoint in her OJT. Her progress has been steady with no major upsets, although as she is exposed to increasing traffic levels she is finding the work more demanding and her efficiency has declined, although this was anticipated and considered to be a normal part of the learning curve that she is going through.</p>
