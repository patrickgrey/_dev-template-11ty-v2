        <p>
                A learning philosophy is a statement or set of
                <strong>statements</strong> that identify an organisations
                <strong>beliefs</strong>, <strong>norms</strong> and
                <strong>values</strong> regarding <strong>teaching</strong> and
                <strong>learning</strong>. These statements influence how students are
                taught, what behaviours are expected of instructors and trainees, and
                more importantly the implicit and explicit values that the
                organisation expresses with regard to learning.

        <p>
                Very few ANSPs have an explicit learning philosophy statement, this
                does not however mean that they donâ€™t have a learning philosophy that
                has over the years become part of the instructing culture.
            </p>

        <p>
                It could be very helpful to consider what philosophy
                <strong>your own organisation</strong> has to learning. Complete the
                following table to get a broad overview of what influences the
                learning environment you work in (of course it is possible that your
                ANSP sits somewhere in between the statements below):

                                    as part of the team. As a result, the OJTIs uses their
                                    pedagogical techniques to provide the training but the
                                    relationship is very neutral and functional. No support is
                                    provided to help the trainee adjust to the social aspect of
                                    working at the unit. This can lead to a trainee feeling
                                    excluded, but the belief is that this is one of the
                                    challenges that the trainee has to overcome to be accepted.
                                    Once they have proved themselves, they are included both at
                                    work and in the social environment.</label>

        <h2>Understanding your learner population</h2>

        <p>For a student to thrive, it is essential that an environment and culture of <strong>openness and positivity</strong> towards <strong>learning and safety</strong> exists.  Learning will be more effective in an environment where everyone feels comfortable about discussing <strong>mistakes</strong>, as well as the <strong>quality</strong> of each other's work, without invoking <strong>blame</strong> or shame.</p>

        <p>Imagine the detrimental consequences and effect on learning for everybody at an ATC Unit where people don't communicate or, more subtly, only communicate about certain things!</p>

      <div class="oj-lowlight oj-hero oj-hero-head-in-hands"></div>

      <div class="ians-column">

        <p>As instructors, we play a vital part in encouraging and creating an optimal learning environment for your students.</p>

        <p>This environment is created by the behaviours and attitudes of the people working there and it is vital that a <strong>culture</strong> exists where learning is actively encouraged and facilitated. </p>

        <p>Unit management also plays a key role in the formation of the workplace culture. In a safe and positive environment, <strong>sharing and reporting</strong> of information about mistakes, incidents and occurrences is shared without fear. </p>

        <p>In a positive environment the student is quickly made to feel a part of a team.</p>

        <p>A poor workplace culture will <strong>prevent</strong> the students from asking the questions that will help them to learn.  They will feel reluctant to report their own and the mistakes of others.  This, in turn, will create a situation which will impact on safety and will ultimately create an air of <strong>learning stagnation</strong> at the unit.</p>

        <p>In an ATC operational environment, there are many different circumstances where some form of training is
                needed and likewise, the people who need this training may have very different <strong>learning profiles</strong>. Bear
                in mind that each person brings with them a particular approach to learning and their expectations of
                the support they will receive from the instructors.</p>

            <p>For Belinda, this is also her first job. However, as a university student she learnt to be an independent learner.</p>

            <p>She expects a bit of guidance from her OJTIs but knows that it is up to her to ask for additional practice if she thinks she needs it. She can identify her own weak areas and take action to correct them without necessarily waiting for the OJTI to brief her on what to do. </p>

            <p>Her university also encouraged her to think critically. As a result she believes it is a positive part of her role, as a new trainee, to observe and suggest â€˜improvementsâ€™ in anything from the way the training is being conducted, to procedures and regulatory requirements.</p>

            <p>Philippe trained as an ATC at a time where he had prove his worth as a controller. This meant that he would always challenge the OJTIs evaluation and fought to defend his actions during training. </p>

            <p>Now he is an experienced controller who is returning to the ACS environment. He believes that due to his experience, his OJTIs will act as facilitators as he figures out what he needs to do.

        <p>An instructor, who has an <strong>understanding of the learning environment</strong> that their trainees have <strong>come from</strong>, and has an adequate set of tools and techniques to work with, will be able to <strong>take advantage</strong> of the positive aspects of the traineesâ€™ learning background. They will also be <strong>flexible</strong> enough to adapt their instructing style to help the trainee achieve the performance objectives they are required to demonstrate.</p>

        <p>Trainees are <strong>not necessarily</strong> all <strong>young  or  new to the ATC environment</strong>. There are likely to be many occasions when the instructor will be training a more mature ATCO who may have moved from one sector or unit to another, or may be undertaking refresher training or remedial training. </p>

        <p>While inter-generational factors have an influence on their interaction with their instructors, these learners are likely to <strong>bring with them</strong> the learning behaviours of the ATCO training environments to which they were previously exposed. This may include instructor-dominated practical teaching interactions and a heavy emphasis on assessment but could also include a high level of self-directed support learning.</p>

        <p>When you are first considering your instructing <strong>approach with a new trainee</strong> it may be worth considering the following:</p>
